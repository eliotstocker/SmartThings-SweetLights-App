Sweet Lights App for SmartThings
--------------------------------

small application that allows looping through hues with Hue and other RGB(W) bulbs with smartthings

included is also a slightly tweaked version of the ZLL device type handler from smartthings to add the ability to set the transition speed when changing colors, the app should work without this, but this gives a smoother transition between colors where the bulb supports the command.
